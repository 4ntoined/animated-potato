13:11- pokemon have stats... that's the latest accomplishment...
this is gonna take... so long
13:44- started implementing moves. kind of really different so far from
how I had things set up in python so it's making me nervous but alas
we march ever forward

00:28- I spent like 4 hours on this just now and in all that time really
the only thing I did was add the timestamps to the mon() objects...
don't get me wrong, there was a lot of time spent researching, and then
more time spent compiling, breaking, and debugging, but I really
wanted to do other things, make progress in other places and it's just
kinda funny to me that what I did instead was something quite superfluous
and not immediately important to the game
