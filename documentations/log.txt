The "Untitled Kotlin Game" Dev Log

28 february 2025
13:25- started the log!
16:44- figured some stuff out. gonna see how far I can go with this...
18:25- progress is slow, but it's progress!! hardwiring the type matchups
is more work than I remember.

1 march 2025
01:06- finished the type matchups!

2 march 2025
13:11- pokémon have stats... that's the latest accomplishment...
this is gonna take... so long.
13:44- started implementing moves. kind of really different so far from
how I had things set up in python so it's making me nervous but alas
we march ever forward.

00:28- I spent like 4 hours on this just now and in all that time really
the only thing I did was add the timestamps to the mon() objects...
don't get me wrong, there was a lot of time spent researching, and then
more time spent compiling, breaking, and debugging, but I really
wanted to do other things, make progress in other places and it's just
kinda funny to me that what I did instead was something quite superfluous
and not immediately important to the game.
16:49- i made the nature lookup table and worked on the mon summary screen.
somehow even after my ordeal last night I still put HOURS into playing
with kotlin/java date-time recording and recalling and formatting mess
hoping I won't have to return to it for a while.

18:26- did a pokédex thing along with a mon-maker function.

17 september 2025
17:09- refined the mon-maker function so that it does randomizing too.
I'm actually kinda proud of this little development, in python these
are two separate function where the randomizer simply picks a dex number
out of a hat and calls on the non-random mon maker function.
with this one, if you don't give a dexnumber, it just randomizes, pretty neat.
I could probably spend a few minutes to work this solution into python...
but i don't think I'm gonna do that right now... maybe one day.
anyway, next thing to do is moves. I will have to go to the python version,
put all the moves data into a csv-type file, and then make a kotlin script to
read that file in and put the data into a list of move() data objects.
this is FUN i am having FUN i ENJOY this work.
^^^ trying to remind myself why I'm doing this.

18 september 2025
12:31- yeah okay i did moves and it went almost exactly according to plan minus
one minor hiccup which I was able to overcome on my first try, so doing pretty good.
next up is programming the mon maker function to give mons moves, also showing moves
in summary, then i think we're ready for party making.
